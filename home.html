        <p>Ragi mudde, a store house of multi nutrients, has only two ingredients, the Ragi (finger millet) flour and water.<br>
             A tablespoon of Ragi flour is first mixed with water to make a very thin paste and later added to a thick bottomed vessel containing water on a stove top. <br>
            As this mixture boils and reaches the brim of the vessel, ragi flour is added which forms a mound on top of boiling water.<br>
             The flour is allowed to cook in this fashion on medium high flame</p>
